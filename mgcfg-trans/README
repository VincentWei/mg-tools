1. What is the mgcfg-trans?
	mgcfg-trans is a tool which used to translate configuration file into c code. It help the MiniGUI to struct the incore resource configueration

2. How to use?
    ./mgcfg-trans -?  to see the help info

3. Macro control in MiniGUI.cfg
Some thing is unused in the MiniGUI.cfg. To avoid the ununsed information to be translated, you can add macro control in the MiniGUI.cfg

At the new line and the first char:

#{{if/ifndef/ifdefine/else/elif ...
....
#}}

"#{{"  tell the mgcfg-trans to expend as C preprocess 
"#}}" tell the mgcfg-trans to expaned "#endif" in the new line 

Use the macro control correctly:
1. for all section, from the beginning of section name:

#{{if ....
[section]
key1=value1
key2=value2
...
#}}

2. for part keys of a section, after the section name:
[section]
#{{if ...
key1=value1
key2=value2
...
#}}
keym=valuem
keyn=vlauen
...

3. the wrong using:
1) cannot add new keys after "#}}" if "#{{" is before section
#{{if ...
[section]
key1=value1
key2=value2
...
#}}
keym=valuem
...
