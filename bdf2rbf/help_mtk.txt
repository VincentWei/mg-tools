How to generate the rbf from BDF files which is translated by the MTK tools?

Open the bdf file by a text editor, e.g vi, and and the special infos in its head:

add "
FONT
"
after the STARTFONT

add "
STARTPROPERTIES
FOUNDRY fmsoft
FAMILY_NAME  gb18030
WEIGTH_NAME regular
SLANT regular
SETWEIGHT_NAME regular
CHARSET_REGISTRY none
CHARSET_ENCODING GB18030
FACE_NAME bdf
PIXEL_SIZE 15
FONT_ASCENT 13
FONT_DESCENT 3
DEFAULT_CHAR 0
ENDPROPERTIES
"
after the FONTBOUNDINGBOX

the "PIXEL_SIZE" should be the frist value of "BBX" in the "STARTCHAR" and "ENDCHAR"
the "FONT_ASCENT" should be the second value of "BBX" - 3, e,g, BBX is "
BBX 15 16 0 -3
"
between the "STARTCHAR" and "ENDCHAR",

the PIXEL_SIZE is 15
the FONT_ASCENT should be 16 - 3
the FONT_DESCENT should be 3

May be the FONT_ASCENT should be the value of BBX's sencod value + its forth value;
the FONT_DESCENT is the absolute value of the BBX's forth value?

Why? It don't known, just do it!
